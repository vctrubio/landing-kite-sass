## Entity Page Architecture

Each primary entity (e.g., Students, Teachers, Bookings) follows a consistent architectural pattern.

- **Data Flow**: Data is fetched on the server and passed to a client-side page component.
- **Filtering**: The page component provides filtering options (e.g., by month, last 3 months, last 6 months, all).
- **Stats Bar**: Each entity page uses the `@components/StatsBar.tsx` component, which updates based on the selected filter.
- **Table Structure**: Each entity page has a dedicated `...Table.tsx` and `...Row.tsx` component to display data.
- **Add New Form**: A form for creating a new entity is included, with its visibility toggled via a `useState` and `useEffect` hook.
- **Master Dashboard (kPlanned)**: All entity pages will inherit from a common `MasterDashboard` component to ensure a consistent layout and shared logic.

### Conventions

- **`components/tables`**: This convention is for components that define the headers and columns for data tables.
- **`components/rows`**: This is for components that render the individual rows of data within the tables.
- **`components/links`**: This is for UI components like dropdowns that trigger API interactions.

## Core Architecture Components

### TimeZone Utilities (`components/formatters/TimeZone.ts`)

A comprehensive timezone-safe utility module that prevents timezone conversion issues across the application:

- **`createUTCDateTime(date, time)`**: Creates UTC Date from date/time strings
- **`toUTCString(date)`**: Converts Date to UTC ISO string  
- **`extractTimeFromUTC(isoString)`**: Extracts HH:MM from UTC ISO string
- **`addMinutesToTime(time, minutes)`**: Adds minutes to time string
- **`timeToMinutes()` / `minutesToTime()`**: Converts between time formats
- **`getCurrentUTCDate()` / `getCurrentUTCTime()`**: Gets current UTC values

**Usage**: Import specific functions instead of using native Date operations to ensure consistent timezone handling.

### Teacher Schedule System (`backend/TeacherSchedule.ts`)

A linked list implementation for managing teacher daily schedules:

- **Linked List Structure**: Each schedule node contains time, duration, and type (event/gap)
- **Static Utilities**: Helper methods for time manipulation and schedule creation
- **Conflict Detection**: Identifies scheduling conflicts and suggests alternatives
- **Gap Analysis**: Finds available time slots between events

**Architecture**: Pure linked list with no external dependencies, using TimeZone utilities for all time operations.

### Teacher Queue System (`backend/TeacherQueue.ts`)

Manages linked list queues of events for teachers on specific dates with drag-and-drop support:

- **Event Node Structure**: Nodes contain lesson IDs, BillboardClass references, and event data
- **Queue Management**: Add, remove, and reorder events in teacher queues
- **Duration Adjustments**: Dynamically adjust event durations while maintaining queue integrity
- **Database Integration**: Create, update, and delete events through API actions

**Key Features**: Handles both existing events and new bookings dragged from StudentBookingColumn.

### Billboard Class System (`backend/BillboardClass.tsx`)

Core business logic class for booking calculations and event management:

- **Booking Data Management**: Wraps booking data with calculated properties
- **Event Minutes Tracking**: Calculates planned, completed, TBC, and cancelled minutes
- **Package Calculations**: Determines remaining time, pricing, and utilization
- **State Management**: Tracks booking progress and completion status

**Integration**: Works with TeacherQueue to provide real-time calculations during drag-and-drop operations.

### Whiteboard Application (`app/whiteboard/`)

The core admin interface for managing daily kite lessons and events:

- **WhiteboardClient.tsx**: Main container component that renders sub-components based on active section
- **Section Components**: Bookings, Lessons, Events, Controller, Status - each handling specific data views
- **Real-time Filtering**: Filters all data by selected date with live updates
- **Event Controller**: Manages event creation settings and real-time schedule coordination

**Data Flow**: Server-side data fetching → Client filtering → Component rendering → User interactions

### Billboard Application (`app/billboard/`)

A drag-and-drop interface for teacher scheduling with advanced queue management:

- **BillboardClient.tsx**: Main container component orchestrating the drag-and-drop scheduling interface
- **TeacherColumn.tsx**: Teacher column component with multi-teacher coordination and global time management
- **TeacherGrouping.tsx**: Individual teacher UI wrapper with drag-and-drop handling
- **StudentBookingColumn.tsx**: Source column for available student bookings with filtering
- **TeacherQueueEditor.tsx**: Streamlined interface for managing teacher event queues
- **BillboardHeader.tsx**: Header component with statistics, settings, and bulk operations

**Core Features**:
- Drag-and-drop scheduling from student bookings to teacher columns
- Real-time queue management with linked list data structures
- Dynamic duration adjustments and conflict resolution
- Global time coordination across multiple teachers
- Streamlined prop management with consolidated objects
- Export utilities for schedule data (CSV, Excel, WhatsApp, Print)
- Filter-enabled booking column with dynamic counts
- Direct TeacherQueue integration for optimal performance

**Data Flow**: Server-side data fetching → BillboardClass instantiation → TeacherQueue management → Drag-and-drop interactions → Database updates
